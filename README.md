# Structural Monitor
Project for IoT Algorithms and Services course

### Project description
This project aims to monitor the structural integrity of bridges,
buildings and infrastructures in real-time.
The system uses a network of sensors, installed on the key points of
the structure, to measure the vibrations and movements.
Each device analyzes the frequency components of the vibrations and
if any abnormal vibrations are detected, the device will trigger an alert
to relevant personnel.
The data collected by devices will also be uploaded to a cloud
database for long-term storage and analysis.
